## Overview

Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.

Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.

Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it [here](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/architecture/README.md).

## Features

- **Local LLMs**: You can make use local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.
- **Two Main Modes:**
  - **Copilot Mode:** (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user's query directly from the page.
  - **Normal Mode:** Processes your query and performs a web search.
- **Focus Modes:** Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
  - **All Mode:** Searches the entire web to find the best results.
  - **Writing Assistant Mode:** Helpful for writing tasks that does not require searching the web.
  - **Academic Search Mode:** Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.
  - **YouTube Search Mode:** Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.
  - **Wolfram Alpha Search Mode:** Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.
  - **Reddit Search Mode:** Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.
- **Current Information:** Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.

It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in [upcoming features](#upcoming-features).

## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Clone the Perplexica repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
   ```

3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml`. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:

   - `OPENAI`: Your OpenAI API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models**.
   - `OLLAMA`: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as `http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER`. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. For other ports, adjust accordingly. **You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's**.
   - `GROQ`: Your Groq API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models**

     **Note**: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.

   - `SIMILARITY_MEASURE`: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)

5. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file and execute:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

6. Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Clone the repository and rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml` in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.
2. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the `ui` folder and fill in all necessary fields.
3. After populating the configuration and environment files, run `npm i` in both the `ui` folder and the root directory.
4. Install the dependencies and then execute `npm run build` in both the `ui` folder and the root directory.
5. Finally, start both the frontend and the backend by running `npm run start` in both the `ui` folder and the root directory.

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like exposing it your network, etc.

### Ollama connection errors

If you're facing an Ollama connection error, it is often related to the backend not being able to connect to Ollama's API. How can you fix it? You can fix it by updating your Ollama API URL in the settings menu to the following:

On Windows: `http://host.docker.internal:11434`<br>
On Mac: `http://host.docker.internal:11434`<br>
On Linux: `http://private_ip_of_computer_hosting_ollama:11434`

You need to edit the ports accordingly.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser's settings.
2. Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.

## One-Click Deployment

[![Deploy to RepoCloud](https://d16t0pc4846x52.cloudfront.net/deploylobe.svg)](https://repocloud.io/details/?app_id=267)

## Setting up Authentication

My fork provides authentication via [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/). 
Follow [this](https://geekscircuit.com/set-up-authentik-sso-with-nginx-proxy-manager/) tutorial to set it up with Nginx Proxy Manger.

To make this work, you have to enable websocket support. Toggle this setting in the Proxy Host configuration.
These are my configurations in the **Advanced** tab of the Proxy hosts:

Frontend:

```text
# Increase buffer size for large headers
# This is needed only if you get 'upstream sent too big header while reading response
# header from upstream' error when trying to access an application protected by goauthentik
proxy_buffers 8 16k;
proxy_buffer_size 32k;

location / {
# Put your proxy_pass to your application here
proxy_pass          $forward_scheme://$server:$port;

    # authentik-specific config
auth_request        /outpost.goauthentik.io/auth/nginx;
error_page          401 = @goauthentik_proxy_signin;
auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie;
add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;

# translate headers from the outposts back to the actual upstream
auth_request_set $authentik_username $upstream_http_x_authentik_username;
auth_request_set $authentik_groups $upstream_http_x_authentik_groups;

proxy_set_header X-authentik-name $authentik_name;
proxy_set_header X-authentik-uid $authentik_uid;
}

# all requests to /outpost.goauthentik.io must be accessible without authentication
location /outpost.goauthentik.io {
    proxy_pass          http://server:9000/outpost.goauthentik.io;
        # ensure the host of this vserver matches your external URL you've configured
# in authentik
    proxy_set_header    Host $host;
    proxy_set_header    X-Original-URL $scheme://$http_host$request_uri;
        add_header          Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;
    auth_request_set    $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie;

# required for POST requests to work
    proxy_pass_request_body off;
    proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
}

# Special location for when the /auth endpoint returns a 401,
# redirect to the /start URL which initiates SSO
location @goauthentik_proxy_signin {
    internal;
    add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;
    return 302 /outpost.goauthentik.io/start?rd=$request_uri;
# For domain level, use the below error_page to redirect to your authentik server with the full redirect path
# return 302 https://authentik.company/outpost.goauthentik.io/start?rd=$scheme://$http_host$request_uri;
    }
```
